## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the lessons in Environmental Data Analytics on data scraping. 

## Directions
1. Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A10_DataScraping.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2. Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3. Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4. Be sure your code is tidy; use line breaks to ensure your code fits in the knitted output.
5. Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
6. When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.


## Set up 
1. Set up your session:

* Load the packages `tidyverse`, `rvest`, and any others you end up using.
* Check your working directory

```{r 1. Project Setup, message = FALSE}
#1 Load libraries

library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(rvest)
getwd()

```

2. We will be scraping data from the NC DEQs Local Water Supply Planning website, specifically the Durham's 2022 Municipal Local Water Supply Plan (LWSP): 
 * Navigate to https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/search.php
 * Scroll down and select the LWSP link next to Durham Municipality. 
 * Note the web address: <https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?pwsid=03-32-010&year=2022>
 
Indicate this website as the as the URL to be scraped. (In other words, read the contents into an `rvest` webpage object.)

```{r set.the.scraping.website}
#2 Set webpage
webpage <- read_html('https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?pwsid=03-32-010&year=2022')
webpage
```

3. The data we want to collect are listed below:

* From the "1. System Information" section:
 * Water system name
 * PWSID
 * Ownership
 
* From the "3. Water Supply Sources" section:
 * Maximum Day Use (MGD) - for each month

In the code chunk below scrape these values, assigning them to four separate variables.

>HINT: The first value should be "Durham", the second "03-32-010", the third "Municipality", and the last should be a vector of 12 numeric values (represented as strings)".

```{r scrape.the.data}
#3Scrape data

water_system_name <- webpage %>% 
  html_nodes("div+ table tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(2)") %>% 
  html_text()

water_system_name 

PWSID <-  webpage %>% 
  html_nodes("td tr:nth-child(1) td:nth-child(5)") %>% 
  html_text()


PWSID 

ownership <- webpage %>% 
  html_nodes("div+ table tr:nth-child(2) td:nth-child(4)") %>% 
  html_text()

ownership

max_day_use <- webpage %>% 
  html_nodes("th~ td+ td") %>% 
  html_text()

max_day_use

```


4. Convert your scraped data into a dataframe. This dataframe should have a column for each of the 4 variables scraped and a row for the month corresponding to the withdrawal data. Also add a Date column that includes your month and year in data format. (Feel free to add a Year column too, if you wish.)

>TIP: Use `rep()` to repeat a value when creating a dataframe.

>NOTE: It's likely you won't be able to scrape the monthly widthrawal data in chronological order. You can overcome this by creating a month column manually assigning values in the order the data are scraped: "Jan", "May", "Sept", "Feb", etc... Or, you could scrape month values from the web page...

5. Create a line plot of the maximum daily withdrawals across the months for 2022

```{r create.a.dataframe.from.scraped.data}
#4 Create a df 


df <- data.frame("Water_System_Name" = water_system_name,
                 "PWSID" = PWSID,
                 "Ownership" = ownership,
                 "Date" = as.Date(paste(2022, c("Jan", "May", "Sep", "Feb", "Jun", "Oct", "Mar", "Jul", "Nov", "Apr", "Aug", "Dec"), "1", sep = "-"), format = "%Y-%b-%d"),
                 "Max_Day_Use_MGD" = as.numeric(max_day_use))

head(df)

#5 Create a line plot 

graph <- ggplot(df,aes(x=Date,y=Max_Day_Use_MGD)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = ('Maximum Daily Withdrawals in Durham Municipality'),
       subtitle = "Source: NC DEQ Division of Water Resources",
       y="Max Day Use (MGD)",
       x=" ")

graph 

```

6. Note that the PWSID and the year appear in the web address for the page we scraped. Construct a function using your code above that can scrape data for any PWSID and year for which the NC DEQ has data. **Be sure to modify the code to reflect the year and site (pwsid) scraped**.

```{r construct.a.scraping.function}
#6. Constrcut a scraping function

scrape.it <- function(the_pwsid, the_year){
  
  #Retrieve the website contents 
  the_website <- read_html(paste0('https://www.ncwater.org/WUDC/app/LWSP/report.php?', 
                                   'pwsid=', the_pwsid, '&year=', the_year))
  
  #Set the element address variables 
  the_pwsid_tag <- ".sortable td:nth-child(1)"
  the_data_tag <- "th~ td+ td"
  
  #Scrape the data items
  the_pwsid <- the_website %>% html_nodes(the_pwsid_tag) %>% html_text()
  the_max_day_use <- the_website %>% html_nodes(the_data_tag) %>% html_text()
  
  #Convert to a dataframe
  df_max_day_use<- data.frame("Date" = as.Date(paste(the_year, c("Jan", "May", "Sep", "Feb", "Jun", "Oct", "Mar", "Jul", "Nov", "Apr", "Aug", "Dec"), "1", sep = "-"), format = "%Y-%b-%d"),
                              "Max_Day_Use_MGD" = as.numeric(the_max_day_use))
  
  Sys.sleep(1)
  
  #Return the dataframe
  return(df_max_day_use)
}
```

7. Use the function above to extract and plot max daily withdrawals for Durham (PWSID='03-32-010') for each month in 2015

```{r fetch.and.plot.Durham.2015.data}
#7 
durham <- scrape.it('03-32-010', 2015)
head(durham)

graph2 <- ggplot(durham,aes(x=Date,y=Max_Day_Use_MGD)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = ('Maximum Daily Withdrawals in Durham Municipality'),
       subtitle = "Source: NC DEQ Division of Water Resources",
       y="Max Day Use (MGD)",
       x=" ")

graph2 

```


8. Use the function above to extract data for Asheville (PWSID = 01-11-010) in 2015. Combine this data with the Durham data collected above and create a plot that compares Asheville's to Durham's water withdrawals.

```{r fetch.and.plot.Asheville.2015.data}
#8 
asheville <- scrape.it('01-11-010', 2015)
head(asheville)

combined_df <- bind_rows(
  mutate(durham, Location = "Durham"),
  mutate(asheville, Location = "Asheville")
)

head(combined_df)


graph3 <- ggplot(combined_df,aes(x=Date,y=Max_Day_Use_MGD, color=Location)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(title = ('Maximum Daily Withdrawals in Durham v. Asheville'),
       subtitle = "Source: NC DEQ Division of Water Resources",
       y="Max Day Use (MGD)",
       x=" ")

graph3
```


9. Use the code & function you created above to plot Asheville's max daily withdrawal by months for the years 2010 thru 2021.Add a smoothed line to the plot (method = 'loess').

> TIP: See Section 3.2 in the "10_Data_Scraping.Rmd" where we apply "map2()" to iteratively run a function over two inputs. Pipe the output of the map2() function to `bindrows()` to combine the dataframes into a single one. 

```{r fetch.and.plot.Asheville.multiyear.data }
#9 

the_years = rep(2010:2021)
my_pwsid = '01-11-010'

the_dfs <- map(the_years,scrape.it,the_pwsid=my_pwsid)

#Conflate the returned dataframes into a single dataframe
asheville_2010_2022 <- bind_rows(the_dfs)
head(asheville_2010_2022)


graph4 <- ggplot(asheville_2010_2022,aes(x=Date,y=Max_Day_Use_MGD)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_smooth(method="loess",se=FALSE) +
  labs(title = ('Maximum Daily Withdrawals in Asheville Over Time'),
       subtitle = "Source: NC DEQ Division of Water Resources",
       y="Max Day Use (MGD)",
       x=" ")

graph4
```

Question: Just by looking at the plot (i.e. not running statistics), does Asheville have a trend in water usage over time?
> Answer: There is a clear trend of an increasing maximum daily water usage from 2015 to 2021. From 2010 to 2015, water usage declied slightly, but there is no clearly visible trend.
