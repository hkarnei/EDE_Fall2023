## OVERVIEW

This exercise accompanies the introductory material in Environmental Data Analytics. 

## Directions
1.  Rename this file `<FirstLast>_A01_Introduction.Rmd` (replacing `<FirstLast>` with your first and last name).
2.  Change "Student Name" on line 3 (above) with your name.
3.  Work through the steps, **creating code and output** that fulfill each instruction.
4.  Be sure to **answer the questions** in this assignment document.
5.  When you have completed the assignment, **Knit** the text and code into a single PDF file.
6.  After Knitting, submit the completed exercise (PDF file) to the appropriate assigment section on Sakai.


## 1) Finish setting up R Studio

### Install TinyTex
Now, run this code cell the same way. This will install "tinytex" -- a helper app that allows you to knit your markdown documents into professional quality PDFs.
```{r install tiny tex, eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
#install tinytext
tinytex::install_tinytex()
```

### Set your default knit directory
This setting will help deal with relative paths later on...
 - From the Tool menu, select `Global Options`
 - Select the RMarkdown section
 - In the "Evaluate chunks in directory", set the option to "Project" (If you don't see this option, try restarting RStudio.)


## 2) Discussion Questions
Enter answers to the questions just below the >Answer: prompt.

1. What are your previous experiences with data analytics, R, and Git? Include both formal and informal training.

> Answer: My academic experience with data analytics includes several courses at the Nic School, such as Modeling for Energy Systems and Electric Power Markets. In addition, I interned at an energy software and consulting company as an Energy Analyst this summer where I worked with large datasets in Python and Excel. I learned and used R in Applied Statistical Methods with Professor Albright in the Fall 2022 and a statistics course in college. I have not had previous exposure to Git. 

2. Are there any components of the course about which you feel confident?

> Answer: I feel confident about being able to code in R and debug my code, and to learn the material taught in class. 

3. Are there any components of the course about which you feel apprehensive?

> Answer: No. Very excited about this course!
  

## 3) GitHub

Provide a link below to your forked course repository in GitHub. Make sure you have pulled all recent changes from the course repository and that you have updated your course README file, committed those changes, and pushed them to your GitHub account.
